## üîë Important Notes

### Email Matching is Critical!
- **The email you use as a student MUST match the email your teacher enters when adding you**
- Example:
  - ‚úÖ Teacher adds: `john@example.com`
  - ‚úÖ Student logs in with: `john@example.com`
  - ‚ùå Student logs in with: `john.doe@example.com` (won't see classes)

### Students vs Classes
- **Adding a student** = Creating their profile in your roster
- **Scheduling a class** = Creating an actual class session
- Students only see **scheduled classes**, not the student roster
- You must schedule classes for students after adding them

### Best Practices
1. Add all your students first (in the Students tab)
2. Use bulk scheduling to save time (it automatically fills in fees and packages)
3. Mark payments as "paid" promptly to keep accurate records
4. Students should login regularly to check their schedule

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "I added a student but they can't see their classes"
- **Solution:** You need to schedule classes for them! Go to the Classes tab and use either single or bulk scheduling.

### "Student logs in but sees 'No Classes Scheduled Yet'"
- **Check 1:** Did you schedule classes for them?
- **Check 2:** Does the email match exactly (teacher's entry vs student's login)?
- **Check 3:** Did you create a student profile first?

### "Bulk schedule isn't working"
- Make sure you selected at least one day of the week
- Verify the number of classes matches your selections (e.g., 2 days √ó 4 weeks = 8 classes)
